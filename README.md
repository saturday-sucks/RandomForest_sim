# RandomForest_sim

This project is made to simulate the Random Forest Algorithm used to make Machine Learning Predictions.

This project aims to do the following 

**1)** Use the Random Forest Algorithm to train and predict patterns in data

**2)** Make a graphical representation of the Trees

**3)** Utilize abstract types for robust usage for different data sets
